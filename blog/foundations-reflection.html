            <h3>Three new things I've learned about myself and my ego as a result of the core learning</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        I can overcome any challenge if I break it down into small steps/goals. This is partly growth
                        mindset (embracing the challenge), and partly to do with problem-solving (breaking things down
                        into
                        actionable steps).
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        I'm an agreeable person, but sometimes that comes at the cost of assertiveness and
                        self-confidence.
                        I reflected on this as part of the strengths and limitations assessment. While the former
                        quality is
                        important to have, so are the latter two, and they are things I'll need to work on in order to
                        reach
                        the goals I've set for myself.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <P>
                        That I'm quite good at implementing small habits, sticking to them, and then building off them.
                        I'd
                        even go so far as to say I'm more habit-driven than goal-driven. Having a routine keeps me on
                        the
                        right track, and I know that if I stick to it I'll see incremental improvements every day. And
                        these
                        small improvements compound over time.
                    </P>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>The role of values, empathy and self-awareness in learning and programming</h3>
            <p>
                These things all impact the way we carry ourselves, the decisions we make, and the way we treat others.
                Even though each of us is on our own journey we seldom travel it alone, and to reach our full potential
                we must stay true to our values, be compassionate to others, and constantly evaluate ourselves to ensure
                we're remaining on the right path. This is especially true in the realms of learning and programming
                where teamwork is often necessary in accomplishing tasks.
            </p>
            <h3>What surprised me the most about the core learning</h3>
            <p>
                When I started on the core learning, I was skeptical about how beneficial it would really be to my
                development. All the reflection questions felt tiresome and I couldn't wait to get back to the technical
                learning. But over the past five weeks I've become more comfortable with it, and through frequent
                reflection I've learned a lot about myself and how I can put myself in a better position to succeed.
            </p>
            <h3>The most challenging aspects of the core learning</h3>
            <p>
                There were times where I looked at the reflection questions and didn't even know where to begin. All of
                a sudden having to turn my focus inward was something I found to be quite challenging, and the critical
                thinking involved was in stark contrast to the technical aspects of the course.
            </p>
            <h3>Why I think EDA, a programming school, is spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web
                development bootcamp course</h3>
            <p>
                My understanding is that EDA is training students so that they're immediately employable on graduating.
                Employers are looking for people with not only technical skills, but also the soft-skills to fit their
                company culture and thrive in a collaborative environment. Hence why there is so much time spent
                focusing on these skills.
            </p>
            <h3>Does the time I spent studying core learning feel like a waste of time? Should I have just used that
                time to practise programming instead?</h3>
            <p>
                In my opinion there was a good balance between core learning and programming, and everything I've
                learned feels valuable in some way. EDA has a solid reputation and strong industry ties, so if the
                curriculum calls for a large focus on core skills then there's obviously good reason for it. As someone
                new to the industry I feel comfortable putting my trust in the experts, and I welcome their guidance
                as to which areas of learning and development will be the most beneficial.
