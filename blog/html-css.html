            <h2>Display: Inline vs. Inline-Block</h2>
            <p>
                Positioning elements correctly on a page is one of the biggest challenges in CSS. There are so many
                selectors, properties and values, it can all be quite overwhelming sometimes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's take a look at one common question - what's the difference between <em>display: inline</em> and
                <em>display: inline-block</em>? Both specify how elements should fit in relation to the surrounding
                content - but which one should you use, and when?
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to answer this question, we should take a step back and make sure we understand the difference
                between <em>inline</em> and <em>block-level</em> elements. Here's a quick refresher:
            </p>
            <figure>
                <blockquote cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Inline_elements">
                    <p>An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <figcaption>- <cite>MDN Web Docs</cite></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                An example of this would be when we use the &lt<em>strong</em>&gt tag. This fits within the flow of the
                text and doesn't cause the text within the tag to sit by itself on a new line.
            </p>
            <figure>
                <blockquote cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Block-level_elements">
                    <p>A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available
                        (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).</p>
                </blockquote>
                <figcaption>- <cite>MDN Web Docs</cite></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                One example of a block-level element is the &lt<em>p</em>&gt tag. This causes the text within the tags
                to begin on a new line. Whatever follows the paragraph will also begin on its own new line.
            </p>
            <p>
                Generally speaking, block-level elements may contain inline elements and other block-level elements,
                however inline elements can't contain block-level elements.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now that we've covered the difference between inline and block, lets look at the difference between
                inline and inline-block. The names give us our first clue.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Display: inline</em> is essentially what we covered earlier in the article. Content will stay on the
                same line if possible, only wrapping onto a new line if there's not enough space. We can specify margins
                and padding for these elements, however only the left and right values will be respected - margins and
                padding on the top and bottom will overlap with other content.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Display: inline-block</em>, as the name suggests, finds a happy medium between the inline and
                block-level characteristics. In some way it gives us the best of both worlds. Inline-block allows us to
                specify the height and width of elements, which we couldn't do with inline. Margins and padding on the
                top and bottom of elements are also respected, unlike what we see with the inline value. The key
                difference between block and inline-block is that the latter doesn't cause the element to appear on a
                new line. Inline-block elements can sit beside one another as friends and equals.
