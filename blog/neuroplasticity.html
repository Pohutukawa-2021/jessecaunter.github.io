            <h2>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h2>
            <h3>How Understanding Neuroplasticity Benefits People</h3>
            <p>To put it simply, neuroplasticity refers to the extent of which the brain can change and adapt to
                learning through repeated activation of the same neurons. The more time we spend learning or practicing
                something, the more we strengthen the neural pathways in our brain for that particular skill. The more
                plasticity our brain has, the more malleable it is, meaning that physiological changes to those neural
                pathways happen at a faster rate. This increases the efficiency of our learning, making it easier to
                recall specific information or excel at a particular task. Although the brain's neuroplasticity
                decreases as we age, there's still great potential for learning in adult life. It's clear to see that
                there's truth to the old adage "practice makes permanent" - so if you understand the science behind
                neuroplasticity, why wouldn't you put in the effort to learn or master a skill?
            </p>
            <h3>Increasing Your Neuroplasticity</h3>
            <p>Reflection and journalling are great ways to improve your neuroplasticity, as you're taking time to
                revisit things you've learned. It's also more of an active thought process as opposed to passively
                consuming information. Visualisation is another great tool to use for increasing neuroplasticity.
                Imagining yourself performing a skill activates the same neurons as if you were actually performing it.
            </p>
            <p>In addition to the methods mentioned above, research suggests that other common lifestyle factors play a
                part in our brain's neuroplasticity. These factors include having a balanced diet rich in healthy fats,
                regularly engaging in physical exercise, getting adequate sleep, and reducing stress.</p>
            <h3>What the Experts Say</h3>
            <p>In the following video, "leading neuroscientists discuss their most recent findings and both the
                tantalising possibilities and pitfalls for our future cognitive selves". It's no quick watch (clocking
                in at one hour), but dives deeper into topics such as how the brain develops, the pros and cons of brain
                plasticity vs. stability, and plasticity in relation to mental illness and recovery from brain injury.
                Hearing a range of issues discussed can help better understand neuroplasticity in a broader context.

            <h3>Growth Mindset - Why it's Relevant</h3>
            <p>Growth mindset is the belief that our skills and intelligence are not fixed. That by challenging
                ourselves with difficult tasks, perservering, and not being afraid of failure, we can grow and excel in
                areas of focus. Having a growth mindset in the context of learning, there's more incentive to work
                harder and embrace challenges understanding that this is how we improve.</p>
            <p>A key area that growth mindset favours is creativity. When a person doesn't fear failure, they are more
                apt to take risks, accept challenges, or put forth new concepts. They know that whatever the
                outcome, it's an opportunity for learning. If we translate this into a broader application,
                employees in a growth mindset organisation are more likely to feel that they can try new things
                ultimately leading to a more positive, fulfilling work environment with higher levels of innovation.
                Employees are less likely to fear that they will be judged or punished for a reasonable risk not working
                out, as their employer values growth and thus will have their back.</p>
            <h3>Instilling Growth Mindset in Children</h3>
            <p>When considering growth mindset, it's extremely important to understand the impact our words and
                attitudes as parents can have on the mindset of our children. This more than likely requires a shift in
                thinking away from some of the traditional parenting methods. One particular thing to consider is
                praising effort and perserverance over result. The former technique encourages children to embrace
                challenges without worrying about getting a particular grade or <em>looking smart</em>, while the latter
                (praising result) makes kids more likely to stay within their comfort zone so that they can maintain the
                'smart' label you gave them by achieving better grades. Children who learn to embrace challenges have a
                higher chance of developing a growth mindset, while those who are driven by results often end up with
                more of a fixed mindset. Another technique we can use with kids is judicious use of the word
                <em>'yet'</em>, for example telling a child that "it's okay they haven't got there yet" - reinforcing
                that learning is a journey and through hard work they will eventually achieve success.
            </p>
            <p>It's clear that a growth mindset can be cultivated in children from a young age. So how do we start
                planting the seeds? This short animated video simplifies growth mindset in a way that kids can
                understand and relate to, and is a perfect introduction for young minds:</p>

            <h3>Integrating Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset on a Personal Level</h3>
            <p>Having the knowledge is one thing, but putting it into practice is where we can gain an edge.
                Understanding how neuroplasticity works, it's clear that the more we practice or visualise a specific
                skill, the more our brains adapt to performing it with greater success. Having a growth mindset through
                this process encourages us to perservere when things are challenging, instead of giving up or looking
                for an easy way out.</p>
            <p>Applying the principles of neuroplasticity to my own journey for instance, I intend to learn and
                challenge myself every day - even if it's just a minimal amount. I'm confident that this frequent
                repetition will help strengthen the neural pathways for the skills I'm developing. I will integrate
                growth mindset by embracing challenges, knowing that by doing things that are difficult or outside
                my comfort zone I'm facilitating my own personal growth and development.
