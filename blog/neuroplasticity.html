            <h2>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h2>
            <h3>How Understanding Neuroplasticity Benefits People</h3>
            <p>To put it simply, neuroplasticity is the science behind the brain being malleable and in an
                ever-changing state. Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity, we realise that there's truth to
                the old adage "practice makes permanent". The more time we spend learning or practicing something, the
                more we strengthen the neural pathways in our brain for that particular skill. This makes it easier to
                recall that information or excel at that particular task. When people understand the benefits of
                neuroplasticity, they are more likely to put in the effort required to improve at something because they
                know that it can be improved based on scientific research.
            </p>
            <h3>How Might We Use it to Our Benefit?</h3>
            <p>Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity, I see that putting in work every day - even just a small
                amount - will help strengthen those neural pathways in my brain.
            </p>
            <h3>Increasing Your Neuroplasticity</h3>
            <p>Reflection and journalling are great ways to improve your neuroplasticity, as you're taking time to
                revisit experiences and things you've learned that day. It's also more of an active thought process, as
                opposed to passively consuming information. Visualisation is another great tool to use for increasing
                neuroplasticity. Imagining yourself performing a task activates the same neurons as if you were actually
                performing the task.
            </p>
            <h3>What the Experts Have to Say</h3>
            <p>In the following video, leading neuroscientists discuss their most recent findings and both the
                tantalising possibilities and pitfalls for our future cognitive selves.</p>

            <h3>Growth Mindset and its Relevance</h3>
            <p>Growth mindset is the belief that our skills and intelligence are not fixed. That by challenging
                ourselves with difficult tasks, we can grow and excel in those areas. Having a growth mindset in the
                context of learning, there's more incentive to work harder and embrace challenges understanding that
                this is where we find growth.</p>
            <h3>What it Changes for Me</h3>
            <p>In this exploration of growth mindset, I was surprised at how much of an impact our words and attitudes
                as a parent can have on the mindset of our children. This was eye-opening for me, and it definitely
                changes how I will be approaching things as a parent moving forward. One thing in particular will be
                praising effort and perserverance over result, as I hope to instill a growth mindset in my daughter.</p>
            <h3>Integrating Growth Mindset into My Learning Journey</h3>
            <p>I will integrate growth mindset into my learning journey by not shying away from challenges. Doing things
                that are difficult and/or outside my comfort zone will help me grow as a person and should be embraced.
            </p>
            <h3>Instilling Growth Mindset in Children</h3>
            <p>It's clear that a growth mindset can be cultivated in children from a young age. So how do we take the
                concept and present it to kids in a way that they'll engage? This short animated video simplifies growth
                mindset in a way that children can relate to, and is a perfect introduction to the idea:</p>

            <h3>Applying Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset to My Learning Plan</h3>
            <p>Having the knowledge is one thing, but putting it into practice is key. Understanding how neuroplasticity
                works, it's clear that the more we practice a specific skill, the better our brains adapt
                physiologically to performing this skill. We can also benefit from imagining ourselves performing the
                skill, as it engages the same mechanisms in our brain. So actively reflecting on what we have learnt
                will help to solidify it. Developing a growth mindset through this process encourages us to perservere
                when things get challenging, instead of looking for an easy way out. Anyone who was ever a master at
                something had to go through many hours of practice, and we can get there too if we're willing to put in
                the hard work an embrace the struggle.</p>
