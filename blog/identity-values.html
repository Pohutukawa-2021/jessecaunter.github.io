            <h2>Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration</h2>
            <h3>Core Values</h3>
            <p>After careful reflection and self-evaluation, I believe these to be my core values:</p>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Kindness</li>
                <li>Resilience</li>
                <li>Health</li>
                <li>Happiness</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>On speaking with close family and friends, they see similar values of integrity, respectfulness,
                forgiveness, courtesy, loyalty, respect, and authenticity.</p>
            <h3>Strengths</h3>
            <p>After careful reflection and self-evaluation, I believe these to be my strengths:</p>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Friendliness</li>
                <li>A good sense of humour</li>
                <li>Attention to detail</li>
                <li>Love of learning</li>
                <li>Intrinsic motivation</li>
                <li>Honesty</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>On speaking with close family and friends, they also see some of the above strengths. Other observed
                strengths include intelligence, empathy, ability to get along well with a diverse range of people, work
                ethic, resilience, compassion, and being calm under pressure.</p>
            <h3>Limitations</h3>
            <p>After careful reflection and self-evaluation, I believe these to be my limitations:</p>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Perfectionism</li>
                <li>Public speaking</li>
                <li>Assertiveness</li>
                <li>Communication</li>
                <li>Self-confidence</li>
                <li>Time-management</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>On speaking with close family and friends, they also see some of the above limitations. Other observed
                weaknesses include indecisiveness, inconsistent motivation, inability to delegate, and conflict
                management.</p>

                    I recall one occasion where a high-school acquaintance of mine was organising a camping trip. I had
                    committed to going because some of my other friends were going, but everyone else pulled out at the
                    last minute. I had an ethical decision to make - bail on the trip like everyone else had, or stay
                    true to my word and go anyway, even though at that point I didn't really want to anymore. I knew how
                    it would make him feel if no one ended up going on the trip he organised, so I ended up going with
                    just him and my girlfriend at the time. We had a lot of fun and I think he appreciated that we still
                    went along. It felt good to make a selfless decision that impacted someone in a positive way.</p>

                    I was born and raised in Auckland, as an only child, primarily by my mum and grandma. My dad passed
                    away before I was born so I didn't have a strong father-figure growing up. Being raised
                    in a working class family I saw the values of hard work and responsibility. My grandma is kind,
                    selfless, and just gets on with things. She looked after me a lot when my mum was living overseas
                    for a year, and I think she helped instill those values in me. Growing up with a predominantly
                    maternal influence helped foster in me a huge amount of respect for women. I'm a peaceful person,
                    and I think that's also got a lot to do with my upbringing.</p>

                <p class="answer">
                    In terms of learning and career development, I believe that my intrinsic motivation and love of
                    learning puts me in a good position to succeed off the bat. I have the drive to succeed and when
                    things get tough I'm pretty resilient. I get along well with a diverse range of people, and I
                    believe that my friendliness, integrity and sense of humour, allow me to thrive in most
                    collaborative environments.</p>
                <p class="answer">
                    The challenges I'm most likely to face will be due to weaknesses in time management, and lack of
                    confidence in some situations including speaking in front of a group. At times I can get caught
                    going too deep in some of the reading materials, or spending too long on a particular task, to the
                    detriment of other tasks.</p>

                <p class="question">
                    <b>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might
                        intersect with learning obstacles.</b>

                <p class="answer">
                    Attention to detail is definitely a strength that could help me in my learning journey, however it's
                    a double-edged sword when taken into account alongside a level of perfectionism and subpar
                    time-management skills. I have to be careful not to spend too much time on the smaller details, and
                    use that time more wisely on other key concepts that are more important.</p>

                        they

                <p class="answer">
                    A situation that comes to mind was my previous job assessing loan applications. Occasionally my boss
                    used to
                    complain that I was too slow, however I felt that I was doing all the proper checks, ensuring
                    correct information was submitted, clear logs were left in the system for future reference etc. I
                    repeatedly made clear that I didn't want to compromise my standards, before eventually agreeing to
                    focus more on quicker response times in the hopes of greater client satisfaction. Ultimately I would
                    slip back into my ways and the problem would resurface next time we were busy. We had different
                    viewpoints and values, but at the end of the day he was the one paying me so I should have made more
                    of an effort to compromise.</p>
                <p class="answer">
                    Reflecting back on this, if I were in the same situation now I'd look to find a compromise instead
                    of being stuck in my ways. I'd use problem-solving skills to break things down into smaller, more
                    manageable steps in order to find a solution. This could have uncovered a more efficient workflow
                    which would have been a win-win for everybody.</p>
