            <h2>Learning Plan</h2>
            <p>The following constitutes my learning plan, and how I will use it to reach my career goals.</p>
            <h3>Long-term Goal and Career Pathway</h3>
            <p>My long term goal in the tech sector is to found a company, possibly in the financial services industry,
                which helps address some of the key issues the world is facing. These issues include equality, climate
                change, and poverty, among others.
            </p>
            <p>Although I don't yet have a clear business idea, I'll continue on my learning journey and see where that
                takes me. This journey starts with Enspiral Dev Academy, where I will learn the key skills to become a
                web developer. On completion of the course, I plan to seek employment and gain valuable industry
                experience. In my free time I'll delve into the realm of hardware, figuring out how to build devices
                that interact with software. By this point I anticipate having at least one or more good business ideas,
                and will look at realising my long-term goal outlined above.</p>
            <h3>Strengths and Limitations - How They Relate to My Learning</h3>
            <p>I believe that my intrinsic motivation and love of learning puts me in a good position to succeed. I'm
                driven to constantly improve myself and when things get tough I'm pretty resilient. I get along well
                with a diverse range of people, and I believe that my friendliness, integrity and sense of humour, allow
                me to thrive in most collaborative environments.
            </p>
            <p>The challenges I'm most likely to face will be due to weaknesses in time management, and lack of
                confidence in particular situations including speaking in front of a group. At times I can get caught
                going too deep into some concepts where a more basic understanding would suffice, or spending too long
                working on a task to the detriment of other tasks.
            </p>
            <p>Attention to detail is definitely a strength that could help me on my learning journey, however it's a
                double-edged sword when taken into account alongside a level of perfectionism and subpar time-management
                skills. I have to make sure that I'm using my time wisely, not sweating the minor details when there are
                other more important things to focus on.
            </p>
            <h3>Core Skills I Aim to Develop at EDA</h3>
            <p>One key skill I'd like to develop is my confidence presenting ideas in front of others. Public speaking
                has always been a limitation for me, and I believe it holds me back from reaching my full potential.
            </p>
            <p>Something else I need to work on is my communication. Being able to verbalise things in a concise and
                confident manner, even just to one person. This is something I struggle with at times, and it could
                stand to be improved on.
            </p>
            <h3>Workload Management - My Commitment</h3>
            <p>I'm fully committed to completing everything that is asked of me, to the best of my ability. I will treat
                other learners, facilitators, and industry/community representatives with respect and kindness. I'm open
                to compromise where a situation calls for it. I will stick to my word, and do what I say I'll do. I will
                not let myself or the team down. I'll manage stress levels by taking some time each day to focus on my
                physical and mental well-being. I'll break things down into smaller tasks so that they're more
                manageable.
            </p>
            <h3>Commitment to Seeking Help</h3>
            <p>Should I ever feel that I won't be able to complete a task on time, or to a high standard, I will bring
                this to the attention of a facilitator at the earliest possible opportunity. I will work with this
                facilitator, and any collaborators on the task, in order to find the best possible solution for all
                parties.
            </p>
            <h3>What I Expect From the Facilitation Team</h3>
            <p>I expect the facilitation team to provide fair and honest advice, feedback, and support, through what
                will be a challenging 15 weeks. I expect them to help me figure out solutions on my own, rather than
                provide the answers I'm looking for.
            </p>
            <h3>Other Commitments to Factor In</h3>
            <p>As a parent with joint custody of my daughter, there will often be times where I need to leave early to
                pick her up from school. This is something that's unavoidable and I'll have to work around it. I don't
                anticipate drop-offs being a problem as I'll try to put her in before-school care.
