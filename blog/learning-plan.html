                <h2>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h2>
                <h3>Long-term Goal and Career Pathway</h3>
                <p>
                    My long-term goal of founding a fintech startup remains the same. Once established, I still plan on
                    using some of the profits to fund charitable causes, doing my part to help make the world a better
                    place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To reach this goal I'm going to need some solid industry experience and connections, so after
                    graduating EDA I will actively seek employment in the tech sector. There's a company I interviewed
                    with earlier in the year, Auror, where there seemed to be an amazing culture and fit. I'd be
                    thrilled if I had the opportunity to join their team and contribute to what they're building. But if
                    that's not to be, I'm sure there are countless roles out there where I'd fit in seamlessly and
                    really make a positive impact.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Meanwhile I'll keep learning new things, honing my craft, and building personal projects in my spare
                    time.
                </p>
                <h3>Biggest Strengths and Limitations in Bootcamp</h3>
                <p>
                    I think my ability to work well with others will be my biggest strength at Bootcamp. This comes down
                    to some of my core values and strengths which include kindness, respectfulness, integrity, and a
                    good sense of humour. I also think resilience and my love of learning will help me overcome
                    challenges when things get tough.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My biggest limitation will most likely be self-confidence in terms of presenting and communicating
                    ideas. Even just the thought of public speaking makes me feel mildly anxious.
                </p>
                <h3>Biggest Non-Technical Challenge at Bootcamp</h3>
                <p>
                    The biggest non-technical challenge for me will be how I balance the demands of Bootcamp with my
                    responsibilities as a parent. There will be many days where I need to leave early to pick up my
                    daughter from after-school care, so I'll need to make up for that lost time with early starts and
                    working on the weekends.
                </p>
                <h3>Human Skills I'd Like to Develop at EDA</h3>
                <p>
                    The most important skill I'd like to develop at EDA is my confidence speaking in front of others.
                    It's something I've struggled with for as long as I can remember, but haven't yet made the effort to
                    overcome. If I'm able to see improvements in this area by the time I graduate, then this Bootcamp
                    will be a huge success for me.
                </p>
                <h3>My Expectations of the Bootcamp Team</h3>
                <p>
                    I expect the Bootcamp team to not only help students expand their skills and graduate, but also to
                    show compassion and understanding for students' lives and responsibilities outside EDA.
                </p>
                <h3>Expectations of Myself at Bootcamp</h3>
                <p>
                    I expect nothing short of maximum effort from myself in this endeavour. I will ensure all challenges
                    are completed to the best of my ability, and no-one I'm collaborating with will ever feel let down
                    by my contributions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I will find at least 10 minutes to meditate every day, and keep up the physical activity to help
                    manage stress levels. If there are any occasions where I'm struggling to manage the workload, I will
                    speak with my Human Skills facilitator as soon as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hope to make some good connections and graduate with a nice portfolio of work, putting me in an
                    ideal position to find employment at the end of Bootcamp. I'm sure I will look back on my time at
                    EDA with fond memories, even though the workload may seem insurmountable at times.
                </p>

                <h2>Foundations Learning Plan</h2>
                <h3>Long-term Goal and Career Pathway</h3>
                <p>
                    My long term goal in the tech sector is to found a company, possibly in the financial services
                    industry, which helps address some of the key issues the world is facing. These issues include
                    equality, climate change, and poverty, among others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although I don't yet have a clear business idea, I'll continue on my learning journey and see where
                    that takes me. This journey starts with Enspiral Dev Academy, where I will learn the key skills to
                    become a web developer. On completion of the course, I plan to seek employment and gain valuable
                    industry experience. In my free time I'll delve into the realm of hardware, figuring out how to
                    build devices that interact with software. By this point I anticipate having at least one or more
                    good business ideas, and will look at realising my long-term goal outlined above.
                </p>
                <h3>Strengths and Limitations - How They Relate to My Learning</h3>
                <p>
                    I believe that my intrinsic motivation and love of learning puts me in a good position to succeed.
                    I'm driven to constantly improve myself and when things get tough I'm pretty resilient. I get along
                    well with a diverse range of people, and I believe that my friendliness, integrity and sense of
                    humour, allow me to thrive in most collaborative environments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The challenges I'm most likely to face will be due to weaknesses in time management, and lack of
                    confidence in particular situations including speaking in front of a group. At times I can get
                    caught going too deep into some concepts where a more basic understanding would suffice, or spending
                    too long working on a task to the detriment of other tasks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Attention to detail is definitely a strength that could help me on my learning journey, however it's
                    a double-edged sword when taken into account alongside a level of perfectionism and subpar
                    time-management skills. I have to make sure that I'm using my time wisely, not sweating the minor
                    details when there are other more important things to focus on.
                </p>
                <h3>Core Skills I Aim to Develop at EDA</h3>
                <p>
                    One key skill I'd like to develop is my confidence presenting ideas in front of others. Public
                    speaking has always been a limitation for me, and I believe it holds me back from reaching my full
                    potential.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Something else I need to work on is my communication. Being able to verbalise things in a concise
                    and confident manner, even just to one person. This is something I struggle with at times, and it
                    could stand to be improved on.
                </p>
                <h3>Workload Management - My Commitment</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm fully committed to completing everything that is asked of me, to the best of my ability. I will
                    treat other learners, facilitators, and industry/community representatives with respect and
                    kindness. I'm open to compromise where a situation calls for it. I will stick to my word, and do
                    what I say I'll do. I will not let myself or the team down. I'll manage stress levels by taking some
                    time each day to focus on my physical and mental well-being. I'll break things down into smaller
                    tasks so that they're more manageable.
                </p>
                <h3>Commitment to Seeking Help</h3>
                <p>
                    Should I ever feel that I won't be able to complete a task on time, or to a high standard, I will
                    bring this to the attention of a facilitator at the earliest possible opportunity. I will work with
                    this facilitator, and any collaborators on the task, in order to find the best possible solution for
                    all parties.
                </p>
                <h3>What I Expect From the Facilitation Team</h3>
                <p>
                    I expect the facilitation team to provide fair and honest advice, feedback, and support, through
                    what will be a challenging 15 weeks. I expect them to help me figure out solutions on my own, rather
                    than provide the answers I'm looking for.
                </p>
                <h3>Other Commitments to Factor In</h3>
                <p>
                    As a parent with joint custody of my daughter, there will often be times where I need to leave early
                    to pick her up from school. This is something that's unavoidable and I'll have to work around it. I
                    don't anticipate drop-offs being a problem as I'll try to put her in before-school care.
