            <h3>Simple Solutions</h3>
            <p>
                Last week I ran into a simple problem, although I didn't know it at the time. We were learning about the
                DOM, and the teaching material was expaining how to select specific HTML elements on a page. There were
                screenshots showing the DevTools console tab with lines of input/output, however when I went into the
                DevTools console tab in my browser it was empty. Hmmm....
            </p>
            <p>
                So why was nothing showing up in my console tab? I tried typing some JavaScript into my text editor,
                saving, and then refreshing my browser - but this wasn't doing what I was after. Why couldn't I see the
                Document Object Model for my page? Was there something wrong with my settings? I started to panic,
                frantically searching Google for answers. How could I work my way through this module when I seemingly
                can't even get to the starting line?
            </p>
            <p>
                I took a break.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I came back to the problem about an hour later, I had left the anxiety behind and was ready to
                tackle the problem step-by-step. I went back on Google and found a video tutorial where I could see
                someone using the DevTools console in real time. They were typing into it. Simple as that. All that
                panic and anxiety I had felt earlier suddenly gave way to a weird mixture of relief and amusement.
            </p>
            <p>
                The biggest takeaway from this ordeal was to do with mindset. Sometimes we're just not in the right
                headspace to solve a problem for whatever reason, no matter how simple the issue. A quick break away
                from the problem can help ease feelings of stress and overwhelm, leading to a greater sense of clarity
                when we come back to it.
            </p>

                Sometimes we face a problem where it's unlikely that we'll stumble on the answer without a proper plan.
                Taking a break can certainly help, but we need some other techniques in our problem-solving arsenal.
            </p>
            <p>
                I found myself in this situation today while working on some JavaScript kata. I hit a wall. The focus
                was built-in methods, and I just couldn't get my head around how to take a sentence string and remove
                every instance of a particular word. I jumped on Google and started searching for answers. But every
                time I found some information that could be useful, my mind couldn't process how it would help me solve
                the problem as a whole. I wrote some code, ran it, saw the error messages and then deleted my code. This
                carried on for a solid 30 minutes at least, and I was getting frantic.
            </p>
            <p>
                Did I figure out a solution?
                <br>Yes.
                <br>So how did I do it?
            </p>
            <p>
                First of all I took a moment to reflect on how I was approaching the problem. I was looking at it as a
                whole instead of breaking it down into smaller pieces. Well there's a good place to start. So I broke
                the solution down into three steps of pseudocode:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Split the sentence string into an array of single words</li>
                <li>Filter out every instance of the specified word</li>
                <li>Return the concatenated string made up of the remaining words in the array</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                I already knew how to code the first step, so I wrote the statement and console.logged it to check I was
                on the right track. Now I was getting somewhere, and felt the confidence start building. The second step
                required me to learn how the filter method is implemented, so I Googled it with an exact idea of how I
                needed it to fit my solution. I wrote the statement and tested it, but got an error message. After a
                couple more attempts I had solved the second step (sort of). I had filtered out each instance of the
                specified word, but this is what I was left with - I actually wanted the other words. So I figured using
                the 'not' operator was the logical fix. Tried to implement this a couple of times and got it to work.
                Great!
            </p>
            <p>
                But hang on a moment. There were still instances of the word that hadn't been filtered due to
                capitalisation of different letters. So I fitted the toLowerCase method as part of the search criteria.
                I had slayed the beast! Now I just had to write the last step which I knew would be easy - a return
                statement which used the join method to concatenate the remaining words in the array. And just like
                that, a problem which had initially seemed so difficult had now been solved.
            </p>
            <p>
                I felt a great sense of satisfaction having put some of the problem-solving techniques into practice and
                overcoming a real challenge. The real key was breaking it into smaller pieces through pseudocode,
                solving one step at a time, and letting the confidence build with each small victory.

            <h3>Problem-Solving Toolkit</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pseudocode</strong></li>
                <p>
                    I've been practising the pseudocode technique and now feel very confident using it. It's just a
                    matter of remembering to use it, as it's easy to jump in and start coding without taking a moment to
                    formulate your plan of attack.
                </p>
                <li><strong>Trying something</strong></li>
                <p>
                    This is usually my go-to, but it can be inefficient without planning out the solution first. I've
                    found that it's easy to start coding and then realise that your solution is not meeting
                    requirements. I'm confident with the technique itself, just need to refine how I use it in
                    conjunction with other techniques.
                </p>
                <li><strong>Rubber ducky method</strong></li>
                <p>
                    I haven't tried this problem-solving method yet. I don't think I'd feel confident using it, but it's
                    important to note that we improve at things through repetition. Perhaps I'll try the rubber ducky
                    method next time and see how it goes.
                </p>
                <li><strong>Reading error messages</strong></li>
                <p>
                    I'm relatively confident at reading error messages, and have been using this technique in
                    conjunction with 'trying something' as a feedback loop of sorts. I wouldn't say I understand every
                    component of the error messages, but I'm generally able to filter out the information I need in
                    order to make the required adjustments to my code.
                </p>
                <li><strong>Console.logging</strong></li>
                <p>
                    I use the console.logging technique sometimes, to check what my code is actually doing and make sure
                    I'm on the right track. For example, console.logging some code to check the output before putting it
                    in a function return statement. I feel pretty confident with this technique.
                </p>
                <li><strong>Googling</strong></li>
                <p>
                    Another one of my go-to techniques, not just for coding but life in general. I'm quite confident
                    Googling solutions, however sometimes getting the wording right can be tricky - especially when you
                    don't completely understand the information you're trying to find.
                </p>
                <li><strong>Asking your peers for help</strong></li>
                <p>
                    This would be one of my weaker areas, and it's a technique that I would generally only use once I've
                    built up a good relationship with someone to the point where I feel confident asking them for help.
                    It depends on the problem though - if it's something where I'd struggle to find the answer on
                    Google, then I'd definitely consider asking peers for help.
                </p>
                <li><strong>Asking coaches for help</strong></li>
                <p>
                    Similar to asking peers for help, I tend to seek the solution myself before asking a coach. In the
                    right situation I would use this method, but it depends on the nature of the problem. My confidence
                    using this technique would be at an average level.
                </p>
                <li><strong>Improving your process with reflection</strong></li>
                <p>
                    I'm not entirely confident using reflection to improve my process, and often don't even consciously
                    consider using this technique. I find that when I do use it, it's generally because I've hit a wall,
                    taken some time away from the problem, and my mind is drifting back to the problem in a calmer
                    state. At this point I do find reflection beneficial, however I'd love to be able to tap into it at
                    will.
